                                                    <p>Yes, indeed, such systems existed for 5 years and before the advent of the Internet, and they work. However, he had several major problems:
                                                        <br>
                                                        <br>1) Different payment systems constantly blocking wallets participants.
                                                        <br>2) Confirmation manual transfers with all the resulting consequences in the form of human factor and constant procedures, who transferred funds to whom and who is not.
                                                        <br>3) There was no recurrence. A person once created a structure and once received money, although relatively large. And then they got all the twists deep into the structure, and the participant did not get more.
                                                        <br>4) Close or hack a site meant a blockade of the system, and sometimes hack sites.
                                                        <br>
                                                        <br>The Criptomonedas and ethereum solves all these problems:
                                                        <br>
                                                        <br>1) Wallet can not be blocked even in theory. The reverse of the coin: in any case, do not lose control of your wallet. It will be impossible to replace your wallet with others.
                                                        <br>2) public transactions and instant automatic confirmations. The human factor is excluded completely.
                                                        <br>3) We did the "Repeat" function, which the participants had previously applied in other systems. Once you create a structure and receive income every year. If people in your structure does not extend its participation each year, your income increases many times. More on page How it works in the "REPEAT" section. 4) Close or hijack the site in any way affect the operation of the system, as the intelligent CRYPTOHANDS contract is loaded into the main network ethereum and no one can delete it, including its developers.
                                                        <br>
                                                        <br>This means that for the first time in the history of mankind (no matter how sound loud), there is a real 100% guarantee that the account will not be pirated, and even theoretically when the site is closed, the Smart Contract and system itself will continue to exist anyway.
                                                        <br>In addition, any programmer in the world can create a new site based on the same smart contract and any leader of the structure can make a site structure on the same smart contract. Therefore, the system is protected from any action by the administration of the project.</p>
